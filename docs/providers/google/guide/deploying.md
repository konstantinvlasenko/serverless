# Google - Deploying

The Serverless Framework was designed to provision your Google Cloud Functions Functions, Events and Resources safely and quickly.

## Deploy All

This is the main method for doing deployments with the Serverless Framework:

```bash
serverless deploy
```

Use this method when you have updated your Function, Events or Resource configuration in `serverless.yml` and you want to deploy that change (or multiple changes at the same time) to the Google Cloud.

### How It Works

The Serverless Framework translates all syntax in `serverless.yml` to a Google Deployment Manager configuration template.

- The provider plugin parses `serverless.yml` configuration and translates it to Google Cloud resources
- The code of your Functions is then packaged into a directory, zipped and uploaded to the deployment bucket
- Resources are deployed

### Tips

- Use this in your CI/CD systems, as it is the safest method of deployment.

Check out the [deploy command docs](../cli-reference/deploy.md) for all details and options.

## Deploying a package

This deployment option takes a deployment directory that has already been created with `serverless package` and deploys it to the cloud provider. This allows you to easier integrate CI / CD workflows with the Serverless Framework.

```bash
serverless deploy --package path-to-package
```

### How It Works

- The argument to the `--package` flag is a directory that has been previously packaged by Serverless (with `serverless package`).
- The deploy process bypasses the package step and uses the existing package to deploy and update DeploymentManager deployments.
